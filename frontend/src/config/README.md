# Site Content Configuration

## 📝 Quick Start

To edit text content on the StudentSignal website, open:

**`siteContent.js`**

All editable text is in this single file. No need to touch React components.

## 🎯 Example: Change College Search Subtitle

Open `siteContent.js` and find:

```javascript
collegeSearch: {
  hero: {
    subtitle: "Your text here..."
  }
}
```

Change the text inside the quotes, save, and the page will update automatically.

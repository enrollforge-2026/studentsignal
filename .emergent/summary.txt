<analysis>
The user wants me to act as an expert software engineer and summarize the work done by the previous AI engineer. I will chronologically analyze the provided trajectory.

1.  **Initial Scaffolding:** The AI engineer was tasked with cloning the Student Signal platform, which is similar to Niche.com. It began by creating a complete frontend-only application using React, TailwindCSS, and mock data. This involved creating multiple components and pages for the main site, user profiles, and an admin dashboard.
2.  **Debugging:** An initial build resulted in a blank screen. The AI diagnosed and fixed a module import error in  by checking console logs and correcting the file path. It verified the fix with screenshots.
3.  **Design Iteration & Reversion:** The AI successfully built the initial version. The user then requested a new, vibrant Campus Glow-Up color palette, which the AI implemented across the app by modifying CSS variables and components. However, the user disliked the new look, calling it too LGBT, and requested a full reversion. The AI successfully reverted all color and component changes back to the original green-and-orange theme.
4.  **Requirement Pivot:** After the reversion, the user provided a new set of critical instructions: keep the current colors, remove all K-12 and Places to Live sections, and redesign the Colleges and Scholarships pages to look and function exactly like their counterparts on .
5.  **Current State:** The AI was actively working on this latest request. It had analyzed the  pages and had begun removing the specified sections from the Header and Footer. The last action was examining , likely to add scholarship data and remove irrelevant content.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to build a full-stack clone of the Student Signal platform, a college search and admissions website inspired by Niche.com.

**Core Features Implemented (Frontend-Only with Mock Data):**
*   A multi-page frontend including a Homepage, College Search, College Detail, Login/Signup, User Profile, and a comprehensive Admin dashboard with CMS and media management capabilities.
*   The initial UI/UX was built to match a specific design style, using a green and orange color scheme.

**Current High-Priority Requirements (Overriding Previous Plans):**
1.  **Feature Removal:** The K-12 and Places to Live sections must be completely removed from all parts of the application (menus, footers, code).
2.  **Page Redesign - College Search:** The Colleges page must be renamed to College Search and its UI/UX must be an exact replica of .
3.  **Page Redesign - Scholarships:** A Scholarships page must be created/redesigned to be an exact replica of .
4.  **Data Integration:** The backend needs to be developed to use real IPEDS data for colleges, replacing the current mock data.

**Design Constraints:**
*   The original green (#1a5d3a) and orange (#f5a623) color scheme must be maintained. No further color changes are to be made.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui components.
- **Backend (Planned):** FastAPI, Python.
- **Database (Planned):** MongoDB.
- **Development Pattern:** Frontend-first development using a  file to simulate a backend, followed by backend implementation and integration.
- **API Specification:** A  file was created to outline the planned API endpoints for backend development.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack monorepo structure with separate  and  directories.



- ****
  - **Importance:** This is the main entry point for the React application, containing the  and all top-level routes for the different pages. It orchestrates the entire frontend navigation.
  - **Changes:** It was created from scratch and populated with routes for all the new pages like , , , etc.

- ****
  - **Importance:** This file is critical for the frontend-only development approach. It centralizes all mocked data (colleges, users, testimonials, etc.), allowing the UI to be fully built and tested without a backend.
  - **Changes:** Created to support the initial build. The last action in the trajectory was viewing this file, presumably to add scholarship data and remove data related to the K-12 section as per the user's latest request.

- ****
  - **Importance:** This page displays the list of colleges. It's a core feature of the application.
  - **Changes:** It was created to display colleges from . It is now slated for a complete redesign to match the layout and functionality of .

- ** & **
  - **Importance:** These files define the main navigation and footer for the site.
  - **Changes:** They were recently edited to remove navigation links for K-12 and Places to Live.

- ****
  - **Importance:** This file documents the API contract between the frontend and the planned backend. It's the blueprint for future backend development.
  - **Changes:** Created after the initial frontend build was completed.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the removal of K-12 and Places to Live functionality from all components and mock data.
- Redesign the  to be a pixel-perfect replica of .
- Create and design a new  to be a pixel-perfect replica of .
- Implement the entire backend as per , including database models, APIs, and IPEDS data integration.
- Integrate the frontend with the live backend APIs, removing all dependencies on .

<current_work>
The AI engineer was in the middle of a significant feature overhaul based on the user's latest request. The immediate task was to remove all references to K-12 and Places to Live and to redesign the College Search and Scholarships pages to match .

**Progress so far:**
1.  **Analysis:** The AI used the  to analyze the structure and functionality of the target Appily pages.
2.  **Code Modification:** It began executing the changes by editing  and  to remove the defunct navigation links.
3.  **Data Preparation:** The last action taken was viewing the  file. This indicates the next step was to modify the mock data to:
    - Remove data related to K-12.
    - Add new mock data for scholarships to support the development of the new Scholarships page.

The project is currently in a state of flux, with the frontend partially updated to reflect the new requirements. The core color scheme and fonts are stable and should not be changed. The primary focus is now on UI/UX redesign and content restructuring.

<optional_next_step>
Continue modifying  to add mock scholarship data and remove any data related to K-12 or Places to Live.

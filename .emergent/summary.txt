<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a Student Signal platform, a clone of Niche.com. The scope of work in this session was extensive, evolving from UX refinements to major feature implementations and architectural improvements, based on a series of detailed, founder-level instructions from the user.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Article Page UX Refinement:** Modernize the article detail page with a unified container, floating video player, reading time estimate, and a read more feature.
2.  **Signal Hub (Student Portal) v2:** Overhaul the student dashboard with a new sidebar, a comprehensive profile view with editable data and badges, a new Schools tab with status tracking, and a To-Do system with a sticky-note feel.
3.  **Data Cleanliness Sprint:** Enforce data consistency across the app by replacing free-text inputs with controlled components:  for dates,  for states,  for GPA, and searchable autocompletes for high schools and colleges, backed by new reference tables.
4.  **Global Navigation Overhaul:**
    *   Implement a modern mega menu system for main navigation items (Student Pathways, Tools, Resources), with dynamically configurable featured content tiles managed from an admin panel.
    *   Fix hover-intent issues to ensure a smooth, professional user experience.
    *   Redesign the global search to be enterprise-grade: an icon-only control that expands into a full-width panel within the header, featuring a smart, three-category autocomplete (Colleges, Scholarships, Majors).

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB platform. The key accomplishments in this session include:
-   **Article Detail Page:** The UX has been fully refined as per user requirements.
-   **Signal Hub v2:** A completely new student portal experience is live, featuring a persistent sidebar and distinct views for the Dashboard, Profile, Schools, and To-Dos. Backend logic for badges, To-Do management, and saved college statuses is in place.
-   **Data Integrity:** The application now uses standardized, reusable form components (, , , , ) across all user-facing and admin forms, ensuring data consistency. Backend reference collections for  and  have been created and seeded.
-   **Global Navigation:** The header features a fully functional mega menu system with dynamic content tiles managed via a new backend API.
-   **Enterprise Search:** A new, sophisticated search system has been implemented in the header. It expands from an icon into a full-width panel and provides real-time autocomplete suggestions categorized into Colleges, Scholarships, and Majors.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent completed a full redesign of the global search system based on detailed Founder-Level Instructions. This involved creating a new enterprise-grade search component that expands within the header, has a specific modern aesthetic matching the mega menus, and includes a smart, three-category autocomplete powered by a new backend endpoint.
-   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
-   **Agent Testing Done:** Y
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. This is a complex UI feature with critical backend dependencies. A test is needed to verify the open/close animations, debounced autocomplete API calls, correct rendering of categorized results, and mobile-specific modal behavior.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   There are no pending bugs or in-progress issues. The last working item is a completed feature awaiting user approval.

**In progress Task List**:

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, React Router, TailwindCSS,  for UI animations, debouncing for search input, hover-intent logic with .
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB (Motor), Pydantic for data models and validation.
-   **Architecture:** Modular frontend with reusable components, creation of backend reference tables (, ) for data integrity, API-driven UI for dynamic content (mega menu features).

**key DB schema**
-   **users**: Added , , .
-   **articles**: Added .
-   **institutions**: (New) 
-   **high_schools**: (New) 
-   **todos**: (New) 
-   **mega_menu_features**: (New) 

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files**
-   **Created:**
    -   : The core component for the new, advanced search UI and functionality.
    -   : The component for rendering the mega menu panels and their dynamic content.
    -   : A new directory containing multiple reusable, validated form components (, , etc.) to enforce data consistency.
    -   : A new directory for the various views within the student portal (, , ).
    -   : A new directory containing multiple simple placeholder pages to prevent dead links in the new navigation.
-   **Updated:**
    -   : Underwent a major overhaul to integrate the mega menu system and the new enterprise search component, including state management for their visibility and interaction.
    -   : Significantly refactored to replace all relevant free-text inputs with the new standardized components from .
    -   : Expanded with several new API endpoints, most notably  to power the new search, as well as endpoints for reference data and mega menu content.
    -   : Updated with several new Pydantic models for the new collections (, , , etc.) and new fields on existing models.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The list of unused old page components (, , ) is still pending removal and is tracked as an upcoming task.
-    now manages state for the mobile menu, multiple mega menus, and the enterprise search. It could be a candidate for simplification using React Context or a state management library.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Powers the smart search suggestions in the header. Fetches categorized results for colleges, scholarships, and majors.
-   : Provides a searchable list of colleges for autocomplete fields.
-   : Provides a searchable list of high schools for autocomplete fields.
-   : Fetches the dynamic content (title, CTA, image) for the featured tiles inside the mega menus.
-   : Full CRUD endpoints for managing a user's To-Do list.
-   : Updates the application status for a college a user has saved.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Adhere to Founder-Level Instructions:** The user provides extremely detailed specifications for UI, UX, and animations. Read these carefully and implement them precisely. The visual style (Student Signal) is well-defined and must be maintained.
-   **Verify Enterprise Search:** The last major feature implemented was the new enterprise search. The user has not yet approved it. This should be the first item you confirm with the user.
-   **Use Reusable Components:** The codebase now contains a library of reusable form components in . Use these for any new forms or when modifying existing ones to maintain data consistency.
-   **Follow the User's Cadence:** The user follows a pattern of requesting a feature, reviewing it, providing polish feedback, and then approving it before moving on. Do not start new, unrequested features.
